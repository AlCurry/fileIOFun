A little learning is a dangerous thing
Drink deep or taste not the Pierian spring.
I enjoy writing code of many styles 
and have fixed many bugs, which can be even more fun.
alas, the complex stuff work of my past is proprietary,
belonging to former employers
putting it out on github was never an option
with luck these diverse examples are indicative
you will not be disappointed by my skill
give me a shot, my break has been long enough
time to do some new work 
if its in Berlin, so much the better
