# fileIOFun
File input and output examples in c++, java, and python.   One file each for C++ (RWfile.cpp), java (RWfile.java), and Python (RWfile.py).
The code assumes the input file will be ac.txt in the same directory, though this is easily customized or parameterized.
Though not well known until well known until arguably the last 5 years, Python (1991) has been around longer than Java (1995). 
C++ precedes both, initially released in 1983, derived from classic C, the antecedent of most modern programming languages, from 1972.  
Many much newer languages have elements of C (e.g. print formatting) or are written in C.
